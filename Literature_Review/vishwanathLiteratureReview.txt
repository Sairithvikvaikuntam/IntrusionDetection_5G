Title: An efficient deep learning model for intrusion classification and
prediction in 5G and IoT networks

The paper underscores the escalating threat landscape of cyber-attacks, particularly with the pervasive use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in e-commerce, healthcare, and communication systems. As wireless network traffic is predicted to dominate Internet usage, the vulnerability of these networks becomes a critical concern, especially with the continual evolution of technologies like 5G and IoT. The literature review focuses on the burgeoning research in intrusion detection systems (IDS) and the adoption of deep learning techniques for enhanced security. The study introduces a hybrid intrusion detection system designed for low latency and high accuracy, employing an unsupervised pre-training autoencoder for feature extraction and a supervised dense neural network for classification. The evaluation, based on the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID), demonstrates the models effectiveness, with particular emphasis on its robust performance in detecting specific attack types. Data pre-processing, model architecture, and optimization techniques during the training phase are detailed. The authors compare their model's performance favorably against other machine learning techniques, highlighting its efficiency in feature selection. Future work is suggested to further improve detection accuracy, minimize false positives and negatives, and extend the model's applicability to a broader range of attacks, particularly in mobile and IoT security platforms.
