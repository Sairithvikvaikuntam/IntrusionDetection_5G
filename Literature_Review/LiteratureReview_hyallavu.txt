Title: Real-Time Intrusion Detection and Prevention System for 5G and beyond Software-Defined Networks

This paper introduces an innovative Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model [7]. The proposed system addresses the critical need for robust security measures in 5G environments, offering essential real-time processing capabilities crucial for high-speed and low-latency requirements. Through instantaneous intrusion detection, integration of machine learning methodologies, and scalability, the system provides commendable accuracy in identifying both familiar and unfamiliar threat patterns. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, tradeoff, reliability, precision, and false alarm rate highlight the efficiency and dependability of the architecture. Additionally, the paper introduces the groundbreaking 5G-NIDD dataset, enhancing research in 5G network security. Overall, this paper presents a sophisticated IDS/IPS architecture tailored for 5G networks, laying a pioneering foundation for future research endeavors and contributing significantly to the evolving landscape of 5G network security.
