Title: Real-Time Intrusion Detection and Prevention System for 5G and beyond Software-Defined Networks

This paper introduces an innovative Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model [7]. The proposed system excels in real-time processing, vital for 5G’s high-speed requirements.The CNN model, employed for preprocessing and analysis,
demonstrates high accuracy in identifying both known and unknown threat patterns. The architecture ensures scalability, and performance metrics, including accuracy, highlight the system’s efficiency. Additionally, the paper introduces the 5G-NIDD dataset, contributing significantly to 5G network
security research.
